u"""report — cards and pointers. OUTPUT IN ENGLISH, comments in Russian.

⚠ REASON TO REWRITE, 21.08. An external reader in the freqtrade Discord wrote:
"it also doesn't list strategies that simply don't load". Formally he is wrong —
227 unmeasured ones are listed with a reason for each. Practically he is right:

  README led to results/INDEX.md — and there were FIVE analysis strategies
  there was no link to corpus/ at all
  corpus/INDEX.md and all 566 cards were IN RUSSIAN in an English-language repository

The information existed, but the front door led to the wrong room. This is my own
class of defect: "we published it" — an answer about the word, not the thing.
You should check not "does the file exist", but "can the reader find and read it".

Measure — AVERAGE TRADE IN PERCENT where available: expectation in currency with
`stake_amount: unlimited` compounds and is not scale-free.
