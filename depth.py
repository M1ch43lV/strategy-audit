"""depth — does buying a deep drawdown work, and can you actually take it?

WHY THIS EXISTS. DCA.md measured what averaging-into-a-position does across
895 public strategies. This asks the question underneath it: after price has
already fallen by u basis points, is the next move better than average?

That question has an answer everyone thinks they know, and the answer changes
sign depending on how deep you cut. Shallow drawdowns are worse than average.
Deep ones are much better. Both are true, and quoting either one alone is how
a real effect turns into a wrong headline.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ASSUMED. The obvious objection is that 2020-2026 was
mostly an uptrend, so "buy the dip" wins by construction. That objection is
not argued with — it is measured, year by year, including 2022, when BTC lost
about two thirds of its value.

THE PART THAT MATTERS. An episode mean averages every hour of a crash,
including the hours near the bottom. You do not know where the bottom is
while you are in it. So the episode mean is not a tradeable number. The only
executable entry is the first hour the condition fires, and that is reported
separately. The two numbers disagree by more than an order of magnitude.
