u"""verify_ledger — the published numbers must be reproducible from the
published data, on a machine that has nothing else.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads `LEDGER.csv`, rebuilds the block of counts, and compares it
to the block sitting between the markers in `README.md`. Exit code 1 on any
difference. No candle data, no clones, no freqtrade — only the two files this
repository publishes.

WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-08-21 the README of this repository said *571 strategies,
55 clean* for about a day after the corpus had grown past 900, and an external
reviewer built a favourable assessment on those figures plus two scripts that
had already been deleted. Nothing was false when written. It simply went stale,
and staleness reads exactly like authority to anyone who was not there.

A rule with no return code does not hold. This is the return code.

    python verify_ledger.py             compare and exit 1 on mismatch
    python verify_ledger.py --selftest  prove the comparison can fail

The self-test is not decoration. A check that has never been shown to reject
anything has not been checked itself — it has only been observed to agree. So
the self-test plants a changed verdict in a copy of the rows and requires the
rebuilt block to differ, then requires an unchanged copy to match.
