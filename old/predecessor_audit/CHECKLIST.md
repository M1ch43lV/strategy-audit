# Thirteen questions to ask your own backtest

Each corresponds to a defect actually found in the public strategies audited
here. None requires judgement, a guru, or a paid course.

**Eight are a single command. Five are a careful read of your own code.** They
are marked, because claiming all thirteen are one-liners would be the same kind
of overstatement this repository exists to catch.

    ⌨  one command      1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12
    👁  read your code   5, 6, 8, 9, 13

Eight come from defects found in the public strategies audited here. **Four —
9, 10, 12 and 13 — come from defects found in this project's own pipeline**,
which is exactly why they are in the list. Number 4 is here because an outside
reader pointed out that it was missing.

Commands assume freqtrade. The reasoning applies to any engine.

---

## ⌨ 1. Is `startup_candle_count` declared, and is it big enough?

```bash
freqtrade recursive-analysis --strategy YourStrategy --timerange 20220101-20220401
```

If it prints *"invalid startup candle count of 0"* and refuses to run, your
strategy has told the engine it needs no warm-up. The engine then requests one
block of candles and discards none — so an indicator that needs 800 bars gets
used before it has converged. Backtests hide this completely: history is always
available there. Live runs are not so generous.

**Passing looks like:** a declared count at least as large as your longest
indicator period, and a table of indicators with near-zero variation.

*Found in 5 of the first 5 strategies audited.*

## ⌨ 2. Does the engine's own bias detector clear you?

```bash
freqtrade lookahead-analysis --strategy YourStrategy --timerange 20220101-20220401
```

Look-ahead bias is when a signal uses information that did not exist yet. It is
the single most common way a backtest becomes fiction, and freqtrade ships a
detector for it that almost nobody runs.

**Passing looks like:** `no bias detected`.

*Note: the first five strategies audited here all passed this. It is worth
saying when a check comes back clean — an audit that only ever reports problems
is not measuring, it is campaigning.*

## ⌨ 3. Is the result significant, or is it noise?

freqtrade prints `Mean profit p-value` in every backtest summary. Most people
scroll past it.

**A p-value above 0.05 means your average trade is statistically
indistinguishable from zero** — no matter how good the equity curve looks. One
of the strategies audited here shows p = 0.13 *in its own author's window*.

**Passing looks like:** p below 0.05, and a trade count large enough that the
test means something (a few dozen trades tells you almost nothing).

## ⌨ 4. Did you beat buying and holding?

The same summary prints `Market change` — what the pairs themselves did over the
window. This is your baseline, and it is free.

A strategy returning +16% in a window where the market fell 58% is doing real
work. A strategy returning +50% where the market rose 400% is an expensive way
to underperform.

**Passing looks like:** you know both numbers and can say which one you beat.

## 👁 5. Can every exit actually fire?

Read your entry and exit conditions side by side and ask whether each exit is
reachable from the state the entry creates.

Real example: an entry requiring `macd < 0` paired with an exit of
`crossed_below(macd, 0)` — which needs MACD to have been *above* zero on the
previous bar. That exit cannot fire until the opposite of the entry condition has
occurred first. The strategy has two exits on paper and one in practice.

**Passing looks like:** for each exit, a sentence describing a path from entry to
that exit.

## 👁 6. Are your trailing-stop settings actually on?

```python
trailing_stop = False
trailing_stop_positive = 0.03   # inert — trailing is off
```

And the mirror image: `trailing_stop = True` with no `trailing_stop_positive`
means the stop trails at your **full** stoploss distance, not a few percent.

**Passing looks like:** the settings you read match the behaviour you get.

## ⌨ 7. What happens when costs are 2× your assumption?

```bash
freqtrade backtesting --strategy YourStrategy --fee 0.001   # then 0.002
```

Fee is a proxy for total round-trip cost: exchange fee plus spread plus
slippage. Backtests fill at the candle open with none of the last two. On
illiquid pairs in volatile periods, doubling the assumed cost is not pessimism —
it is realism.

**Passing looks like:** your edge survives 2-3× your assumed cost. If it does
not, you do not have an edge — you have a fee arbitrage against your own
optimism.

Measured on the five strategies audited here, raising cost from 0.1% to 0.3%
per side leaves **three of them with nothing inside their own author's window** —
two negative and one at +0.01%, which is zero:

```
avg trade %                     0.1%     0.2%     0.3%  per side
EMAPriceCrossoverWithThreshold  1.39     1.19     0.99
RSIDirectionalWithTrendSlow     1.03     0.82     0.62
MACDCrossoverWithTrend          0.42     0.21     0.01
DoubleEMACrossoverWithTrend     0.38     0.18    -0.02
RSIDirectionalWithTrend         0.34     0.14    -0.06
```

## 👁 8. Does the result hold outside the window you developed in?

Split your data. Develop on the first part; never look at the second until you
are done. Then run once.

Of the first five strategies audited here, all five degraded out of sample; two
retained under 10% of their per-trade edge, and one turned negative.

**Passing looks like:** an out-of-sample expectancy that is a meaningful
fraction of the in-sample one — and you decided what "meaningful" was before you
looked.

*This is an out-of-sample test, not a walk-forward analysis. Walk-forward means
rolling or anchored windows with re-fitting at each step. Calling one the other
is a terminology error worth avoiding — including by us: an earlier version of
this repository used the wrong word.*

## 👁 9. Can someone else reproduce your number — and is your metric scale-free?

If your headline is "Total profit %", it depends on `max_open_trades`,
`stake_amount` and `dry_run_wallet`. Without those published, the number is not
wrong — it is **undefined**. The same trade list under different settings gives
completely different totals.

**And per-trade expectancy in currency is not the escape it looks like.** Under
`stake_amount: "unlimited"` — the common default — freqtrade splits the wallet
across open slots and compounds, so later trades are placed with larger stakes
and an expectancy denominated in USDT is inflated by account growth rather than
by skill. This repository published exactly that mistake and corrected it: one
strategy's retained edge moved from 5% to 26% when measured scale-free.

**Passing looks like:** your headline is **average profit per trade in percent**,
or your full config is published alongside a currency figure. If you cannot say
what stake produced a number, you do not yet know what the number means.

## ⌨ 10. Did the engine run the timeframe you think it ran?

```bash
freqtrade backtesting --strategy YourStrategy ... 2>&1 | grep "Strategy using timeframe"
```

A `timeframe` key in your **config** silently overrides the one your strategy
declares in its own source. There is no warning. A 5-minute strategy will run on
hourly candles and return a complete, plausible result — thousands of trades, a
respectable equity curve, nothing amiss in the output.

This is not hypothetical: it happened here, to this pipeline, across a
corpus sweep, and was caught only by counting how many strategies declared which
timeframe. The published audits were unaffected because those strategies happen
to declare `1h`; everything else was invalid.

While you are reading that log, also check for:

```
WARNING - No history for DASH/USDT, spot, 1h found
```

The engine warns and **keeps going on the remaining pairs**. Your result is then
computed over fewer instruments than you think, and is not comparable to one that
was not.

**Passing looks like:** the timeframe in the engine's log matches the one in your
strategy file, and there are no missing-history warnings — or you know exactly
which pairs are missing and say so alongside the number.


---

## ⌨ 11. How long is your average trade, measured in candles?

Divide the average trade duration by your timeframe. If the answer is close to
one — or below it — a large part of your result was produced *inside* single
candles, where the engine is modelling rather than replaying.

> **Corrected 2026-08-22, after `stash` in the freqtrade Discord said "it's not
> really a trap".** He was right and the original wording here was wrong. It
> said the engine's same-candle assumption is "usually the flattering one".
> Reading `backtesting.py` shows the opposite for freqtrade: for a trailing stop
> triggering in the entry candle it takes the **most pessimistic** path —
> *"moving just enough to arm stoploss and immediately going down to stop
> price"* — and it clamps the result to the candle low so the fill stays
> realistic. The engine errs against the strategy, not for it.

What survives is weaker and still worth knowing: **a strategy whose average
trade is shorter than its own candle is operating below the resolution of its
data.** Its result rests on the engine's modelling assumptions rather than on an
observed sequence of prices. Those assumptions are documented and conservative,
so this is a *reliability* caveat, not a flattery trap — and if the number
matters to you, the answer is to re-run on finer data, not to argue about the
model.

Scale: in a corpus of 895 strategies, 496 had a measurable duration and
**exactly one** traded below its own candle. It is a rare condition, and this
question is here for the case where it applies, not because it is common.

**How to check:** freqtrade prints `Avg. Duration` in the `ENTER TAG STATS`
table. Compare it with your timeframe.

```
Avg. Duration   0:05:00      on a 5m strategy   <- one candle: distrust
Avg. Duration   4 days       on a 5m strategy   <- fine
```

**Passing looks like:** average duration is several candles or more, and if it
is not, you have tick or 1m data behind the claim rather than the same candles
the signals came from.

*Found because a strategy in this corpus survived every statistical gate with an
average hold of under one candle. Nothing statistical can see that; the ratio
can.*

---

## ⌨ 12. How many strategies did you try before this one?

A p-value of 0.05 means one in twenty by chance. If you tested forty variants
and are reporting the best, roughly two of them were expected to clear that bar
while being worthless — and you would have no way of telling which.

This applies to hyperopt runs, to parameter sweeps, and to "I tried a few ideas
and this one worked". Every one of them is a test, whether or not you wrote it
down.

**How to check:** count the tests honestly, then apply a correction. Benjamini–
Hochberg controls the share of false discoveries among the ones you keep, and is
a few lines of code:

```python
s = sorted(pvals); n = len(s); k = 0
for i, p in enumerate(s, 1):
    if p <= 0.05 * i / n:
        k = i        # k hypotheses survive; the threshold is s[k-1]
```

**Passing looks like:** the number of tests is stated, and the surviving
p-values clear a corrected threshold rather than a raw 0.05.

*This repository failed this check itself until an outside reader pointed it
out. Hundreds of strategies were run against p < 0.05 twice, and the correction
was added afterwards — which is recorded as a post-data decision rather than
folded in quietly.*

## 👁 13. Can the number in your README be regenerated from today's code?

Not "was it true when you wrote it". Whether, right now, running what is in your
repository produces the figure your README shows.

Documents outlive the code they describe. A results table stays persuasive long
after the script that produced it has been rewritten or deleted, and a reader
has no way to tell the difference — the stale number and the current one look
exactly alike.

**How to check:** delete the number from your README and regenerate it. If you
cannot, the number is a memory, not a measurement.

**Passing looks like:** the published figures are written by a script, and
something with an exit code refuses to let them disagree — a pre-commit hook, a
CI job, anything that fails rather than warns.

*Found in this repository. Its README carried "571 strategies, 55 clean" for a
day after the corpus had grown past 900, and an external reviewer built a
favourable assessment on those figures plus two scripts that had already been
deleted. Nothing was false when written. See `verify_ledger.py`, which is the
return code that now enforces it.*

---

## What this checklist cannot tell you

Whether your idea is any good. Every check above is about whether your
*measurement* is trustworthy. A perfectly measured strategy with no edge is
still a strategy with no edge — you will simply know it sooner and for less
money.

That is the whole value on offer here, and it is worth stating plainly rather
than dressed up.
